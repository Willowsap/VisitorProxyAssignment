# Vistor / Proxy Assignment

To put it simply, implement ProxyNode, Traverser, Visitor, and create a concrete visitor.
Proxy node should have some sort of function such as being a virtual proxy or a protection proxy.
The concrete visitor can do any sort of algorithm you want. For example, you could count total nodes (including those in sub-lists),
you could count the number of sub-lists, you could get the average of all the numbers, you could get the ratio of doubles to ints to node nodes.
The sky is the limit.<br>

Finally, you should update the demo to use your visitor and proxy.<br>

More detailed descriptions, ideas, and suggestions are given in class, but if you miss them, that's on you.<br>
